# 2048Clones
2048 Clones I wrote during the beginning of Sophomore Year.

I created the Matlab version of the game in a few days as a personal project.  It can be executed by running GUI2048.m.  (Note the mouse controls were never implemented.  To play, use wasd in the console and hit enter after each move.)

The C++ version was created as a final project for my Fundamentals of Computing Class.  The GFX library was provided by Notre Dame.
